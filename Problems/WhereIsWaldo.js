/*
	Where's Waldo?
	Return the number of string permutations (a.k.a. rearranging all of letters) of SWALLOWED
	that contain the substring WALDO

	EXPECTED OUTPUT: 120

	Hint:  This obviously builds upon the StringPermutations problem.  Just be careful in this case
	       to check for repeated words, since SWALLOWED has multiple W's and L's!
